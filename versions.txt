Ideas for development:
- Increase capacity of solvent list to show abbreviations. Add a 2nd list.
- Differentiate between expiration date and open date for solvents:
- Problems might arise with samples starting with an A or B!
- Make sure when checking for solvents the right line is checked!
- Add the syntax for samples to UI.
- Check clearly what is necessary: Either peak table or Compound results!
- Standardize the rawfile output!
- Standardize the template input!


v 0.8.2
- Improved the find_solvent_data function. Should now always return the correct data.
- Solvent data and some CoA data is now added as either integer or float to template instead of string.
- A and B files are now distinguished from Sample files.

v 0.8.1
- Improved chart layout
- Removed incorrect reference on cell E38

v 0.8
- Introduced modern and dynamic GUI.

v 0.7
- Reorganized code. Introduced Class Template.
- Updated GUI layout.

v 0.6
- App now has a GUI and will no longer display the console.

v 0.5
- Changed the order of the CoA format to: Solvent  Manufacturer  Catalog #  Lot #  Expiration date (mmmyyyy)  purity (00.00%).pdf
- Added an improved "___ NOTE" message in CoA folder to explain the correct format including an example.
- App will stop searching A and B txt files once a solvent has been found to avoid the extraction of incorrect data.
- Current version will work on english versions of Excel only.
- Supports up to 9 A-files (A1 to A9) but still needs a minimum of 8 A-files (A1 to A8).
- CoA files are now optional.
- If purity of solvent is not provided in CoA file, 100% is assumed.
- Solvents which are currently supported: "1,2-dioxane 1,4-dioxane 2-BuOH 2-MeTHF n-PrOH acetone DCM DMF iPrOAc IPA MeOH MeCN EtOAc EtOH TBME pentane Et2O THF DMSO"
